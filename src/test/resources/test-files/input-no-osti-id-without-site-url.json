  "description": "This data package includes a time-series of field measurements from March to October 2021 in groundwater and surface water from the Slate River floodplain in Crested Butte, CO, a focus field site for the SLAC Floodplain Hydro-Biogeochemistry SFA. The data was generated as part of the work targeting the overarching research question for the SLAC SFA: How do ubiquitous subsurface interfaces mediate molecular-scale biogeochemical processes and groundwater quality in floodplains and watersheds? The data package includes 5 data files, one for each measured variable: specific conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, water temperature and alkalinity. All measurements were recorded in the field immediately after water sampling. Groundwater samples were extracted from a network of installed rhizons (Rhizosphere Research Products, part no. 19.60.21F, 0.6 micrometer mesh size) and piezometer wells within the floodplain. In addition to the data files, there is a terminology file explaining the terms used, a file level metadata file, and a sensor file with metadata about the sensors used.\nAll files are in csv format.",
